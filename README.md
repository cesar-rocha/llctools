QTools for analyzing Lat-Lon-Cube simulation outputs

# Goals
The idea here is to put together codes for analyzing the LLC output.
We will start by building tools that allow to quick analyze spectral
properties across multiple regions. Parts of the code will leverage
on Ryan's MIT-gcm parallel analysis code.
